When the company takes them abroad on holiday, it motivates them to perform better in future. As they get recognised by the company, they gain a lot of respect from their family members. In turn, their respect for the company also goes up,” said Aggarwal.</p>\r\n<p>   \r\nIn terms of rewarding loyal and high-performing employees, none can perhaps beat Surat-based diamond merchant Savji Dholakia, who gifted Mercedes Benz SUVs worth Rs 1crore each to three of his employees last year for completing 25 years of service in his Hari Krishna Exports, which clocks more than Rs 6,000crore turnover per annum.

Quantum computers might one day revolutionise tasks that would take existing computers years, including the hunt for new drugs and optimising city and transportation planning. </p>  \r\n<p>  \r\nThe technique relies on quantum bits, or qubits, which can register data values of zero and one — the language of modern computing — simultaneously.

You just need to keep below-listed recommendations so as to protect your business from DDoS attacks<br />\r\nKnow your security concerns and create a defensive strategy:<br/><br />\r\nIn order to assure that your business is completely safe and protected from DDoS attacks, you just need to develop the security policy of IT. One such security gets developed, be sure to share it with personnel of all the companies and assure that you have a secure network.<br/> <br />\r\nUp-to-Date Security Safeguards: <br/><br />\r\nTo defend your system from DDoS attack in all the best possible ways, it is mandatory that all your hardware, software, as well as other security safeguards, are up to date. Apart from this, strict password policies are often paramount and mandatory in keeping your systems secure. Thus, below-listed points would help you in developing all forms of business-related passwords such as: </p><br />\r\n•    Create a unique password for each account <br/><br />\r\n•    Create a password with a blend of letters, numbers, and symbols <br/><br />\r\n•    Never use common words and personal information <br/><br />\r\n•    Update and change your password on equal time intervals <br/><br />\r\n<strong>Concentrate on Network Security</strong><br />\r\n<p>Concentrating on the concerns of your network security, it’s better to keep in a touch with a network security specialist who consists of the knowledge and years of experience with cybersecurity. This is because his assistance holding such of the specialities would be highly able to give compete for network security at times as per the needs of the people and end-users. <br/><br />\r\nSo, what if a DDoS Attack Happens to Your Business? What to do in such a case? <br/><br />\r\nPrepare yourself to know that defending your business from DDoS attacks will not stop with mitigation and prevention. Therefore, it is very mandatory for your business to include a response plan as a member of its defence strategy. Having such kind of plan would help you rebound faster from the attacks.<br/><br />\r\nIn addition to this, it is also suggested to work with your ISP to see if they offer DDoS protection services so that if an attack occurs in a near-future then, you may let them know and they may reroute the traffic from a site prior to substantial damage is done. </p><br />\r\n<p>So, always assure that, whenever DDoS attacks are found to be on the rise, all such steps must be taken into consideration in order to mitigate the associated risks of these attacks.

The stench was so foul that I could not only smell but taste it.</p>   \r\n<p>   \r\nI made the mistake of stepping out onto my balcony to get some fresh air but instead I inhaled <strong> toxic fumes</strong>.

Our government - the people we elected to protect our well-being are the ones who - should be finding a way out. And fast.</p>   \r\n<p>   \r\nBut instead what we saw playing out in the news was a blame game. One state blaming another. “Stop your farmers from burning rubble”. “No, you people need to curb vehicular pollution.” “Go regulate construction dust first”.</p>   \r\n<p>   \r\nFrankly, I don’t care who did what and why.

Lucky are the citizens of the country that gets served with such opportunities, timely. Whereas, commonly, it’s a well-known and genuine process of choosing a representative of their choice via Elections. </p><br />\r\n<p>A country which is democratic and values the people’s identity and dignity irrespective of any religion, caste or creed; faces and respects the process of Elections. Ranging from the election of Lok Sabha (General Election), State Assembly (Vidhan Sabha Election), By-election, Rajya Sabha (Upper House Election) each citizen of the nation has a complete right to vote. <br />\r\nAs mentioned above <strong>“One Vote, One Value”</strong> has a major meaning in itself that couldn’t be taken for granted. This majorly means that each candidate can vote once during the time of Elections to their preferred party. This is so because each casted vote gets counted to announce the results. It’s our casted vote that we perform to choose the party to be ruled after the results get announced on the specified date.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Sooner, the National Capital Region i.e. New Delhi is going to have Elections to choose the Chief Minister of the Nation. As of now, the present C.M. of Delhi is Mr Arvind Kejriwal who belongs to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) having a symbol of Broom. Fingers Crossed, it all depends on the number of votes that whether again AAP is going to rule, or some other party would overtake AAP.</p> <br />\r\n<strong>Polling Dates</strong><br />\r\n<p>Since the date of Election in Delhi has been announced as 8th February 2020 (Saturday), the Election Commission of India announced its complete schedule prior a month back in order to elect the legislative assembly of Delhi. Alongside this, the result will be announced on 11th February 2020 (Tuesday). </p><br />\r\n<p>In addition to this, as per the Election Commission of India, the vote’s counting would begin from early morning 8 am onwards until 6 pm on Saturday: 11th Feb. Whereas, the entire tenure of the present Delhi Legislative Assembly would come to an end on 22nd February 2020 (Saturday).</p>  <br />\r\n<strong>Political Parties are on Race</strong><br />\r\n<p>Also, all the casting voters must also enlighten that the Assembly Election 2020 would occur in a single phase abreast with the voting in all 70 constituencies which have been scheduled for Feb 8. All the political parties are cheering up and boosting themselves to be healthy as well as a successful part of the election. However, as per the political scenarios, there have been 3 concerned contests amid Congress, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). People just could only assume or predict based on their interest and votes that which party would going to rule. However, the final result will be declared on Feb 11. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Vote has a deeper meaning and value </strong><br />\r\n<p>So, cast your vote because your one vote can change the entire scenario, in fact, at the last moment and could lead a nation towards the healthy and developed ones. Thus, on the polling date i.e. on Feb 8, voters can exercise their franchise from morning 8 am onwards. However, it is also suggested, and one should make a note of it that, you should not vote to the candidate getting influenced by your near and dear ones. This is so because, most of the times, people vote to those parties by getting influenced from their friends, family members, relatives or other acquaintances. On the other hand, the people who influence others are also requested not to brainwash or influence others in such a way that their vote seems useless or gets wasted. Doing so results in malpractices for both the people; the one who gets influenced and the one who influences others. </p><br />\r\n<p>Observing all such observations, the Election Commission of India has moved towards the EVMs (Electronic Voting Machine). EVMs have replaced the concept of Ballot Papers because people were encouraging others for forceful voting and were encouraging the candidates towards the victory. Thus, such practices are of no use, if each one would influence others for forceful voting. Basically, such kind of practice had also become a monotony as well wherein, family traditions could be listed on top. This is so because, most of the Family’s HOD say that, we have always been a supporter of this particular party from our generations so, we will be casting our vote to the same without knowing that what are their right and wrongdoings.<br />\r\nSo, open up your mind and be so rational to caste a right vote to the right candidate or a ruling party.  </p><br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	6000,	2,	'2020-02-10 04:23:08',	'2020-02-10 12:35:23'),

The strategy of acquiring the bulk votes was quite interesting   \r\nas it focussed on BPL household visits while sitting on the muddy floor and eating   \r\nthe meal cooked on the earthen stove or Chulhas.  </p>\r\n<p>  \r\nHowever, to get the LPG cylinder under this scheme the BPL family woman required   \r\nto fill a form provided by the respective gas agency while paying the subsidized price   \r\nof ? 1750 otherwise without such scheme it would be costing ? 2950. </p>\r\n   \r\n<strong>A Curse or A Cause</strong>\r\n<p>   \r\nPeople of such families did enjoy the scheme until the time the cylinder doesn’t   \r\nrequire the refill. With the passing away of the gas, they again came back to the   \r\nChulhas using kerosene oil and other kinds of solid fuels. The emitted smoke from   \r\nsuch substances led to hazardous health issues. Moreover, as per the World Health   \r\nOrganisation, worldwide, 3.8 million people die because of the smoke exposure from   \r\nthe dirty stoves. Also, the stats obtained from WHO quoted that in India, 4,88,200   \r\ndeaths occur every year just because of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   \r\n(COPD), ischaemic heart disease, due to pneumonia, lung cancer, and stroke. Also,   \r\n8 complete years are lost amid 1,000 people majorly because of the indoor air   \r\npollution wherein, the most affected people are the children and the woman. </p>   \r\n<strong>Saving Wealth or Losing Health</strong> \r\n<p>   \r\nBoth the Indian societies as well as the government need to understand that cooking   \r\non Chulhas renders a huge number of fumes and smog which adversely affect the   \r\nenvironment then, how a human being can remain unaffected from the same? If,   \r\nUjjwala Scheme has been properly implemented focusing on the low cost of the gas   \r\nrefill then, it could have successfully helped the sufferers which they have been   \r\nfacing because of the constant use of Chulhas.   </p>\r\n<p> \r\nThe use of Chulhas adversely affects human health that it can cause a loss of vision,   \r\nlungs problem, inhaling or other breathing problems and a lot more than one can   \r\never imagine. For your safeguard, you need to take any action while not fully relying   \r\non government schemes. However, the government must support people with the   \r\nproper implementation of such schemes. It must organize the schemes that it may   \r\nnot affect the people for a shorter time span, in fact, help them in solving all their   \r\ndaily hurdles.  </p>  \r\n<strong>One Initiative is Essential</strong>\r\n<p>   \r\nThe people of such areas are out of the reach of a flourished money, so they feel   \r\nthemselves helpless. At least, one can be a light of help for them so that with one’s   \r\n   \r\ninitiative the entire society can be saved. Also, as per the government concerns, it   \r\nshould have set up the reasonable prices of gas refilling that people from Chulhas   \r\nmay move towards the LPG. This would surely bring a positive effect on society and   \r\nthe economy.  </p>\r\n<p>  \r\nAgain, the concluded reason states that the unaffordability of LPG cylinders is the   \r\ncore concern of using Chulhas with the help of cow dung and coal that are easily   \r\naccessible. Else, in the fastest running era of the technology where Gas Stove is   \r\nbeing also replaced by the Electronic Induction, who wants to cook food on the   \r\nburning wood emitting fumes. The Government needs to reduce the prices of gas   \r\nrefilling that no house may remain left with the LPG cylinders.    \r\nPeople must also know the worth and importance of their health and time which is   \r\nbeing wasted sitting in front of Chulhas.</p>',	0,	0,	0,	2000,	1,	'2019-12-03 12:27:01',	'2020-02-07 16:35:35'),

Does inner beauty really matter or is just a matter of   \r\nwords?   \r\nMost of the time, people say that inner beauty, good heart, and hard work means   \r\neverything but deep inside, everyone goes beyond physical beauty and appearance.   \r\nThis is just to show the sympathy or a kind of show-off towards the victims of acid   \r\nattack. </p>\r\n<p>  \r\nThe bitter, as well as the harshest reality, is that society is cruel because when people   \r\ntaunt everyone on body shaming focusing on height, weight, health, complexion and   \r\nphysique then, acid attack is a big deal to tackle with.   \r\nSuch victims are not the culprits to be treated helpless in fact, why to make them a   \r\nvictim?

Moreover, the prices are expected to soar more by the end of February 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Triggering of Unseasonable Rainfall led Crop Damage  </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prices of onion have risen drastically in all over the country. The reason behind the rising cost is unseasonal rain as well as the shortage of onion crop. Also, the worst part is that the rising cost has not even benefited a single farmer instead they have complained that none of the onion crops has been fetched because of its poor quality. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Increasing Consumption led to Decreasing Requirements </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In accordance with some sophisticated sources, in India, the monthly consumption of onions was 15 lakh metric tons which shows a requirement of 50 thousand metric tons. But, with the high cost, the daily supply has become 10-12%, as of now. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Appeal to Government – a Solution for a Common Man</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people and other associated welfare bodies have asked the government to create onion’s buffer stock, distribution of the staple at a reasonable cost, a crackdown on the hoarding of onion’s traders, etc just to relief a middle class and a common man. Onion as a staple of each kitchen in every household has affected not only the general public but a huge mass of farmers as well. Indian farmers have emotionally expressed a painful concern because most of them are distributing the old stock of onion because of the damaging of new onions. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because the wholesale market has seen a huge spike in the cost, it has simultaneously affected the resulting market as well. Wherein, this sharper jump is restricting the public to make a hole in their pockets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nationwide surge in the spike of onion price has affected most of the Indian states and cities such as Pune, Maharashtra, Chennai, Mumbai, Odisha, West Bengal, Kolkata, Delhi and a lot more. Therein, it has affected the market chain by affecting both the sellers and consumers in buying an onion. Nevertheless, daily consumers are unfortunately are forced to reduce their purchases and are cooking their delicious food as – onion free. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Battlefield between State & Central Government </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the worst condition expressed by the farmers is the rotten onion which can neither be used nor purchased and can only get wasted by throwing and dumping it in the dustbins. Most of the citizens have appealed to the Central Government to take impactful immediate actions but, the tussle amid the state and the central government is affecting the common man, alas!!! </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Onion’s Robbery at Dusk’s Early Hours </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the robbery of goods that can benefit you in any ground has been seen and observed in several different cases. But, have you ever heard of Onion’s robbery. Could you ever imagine that onions can also be getting stolen? Sounds funny; but, it’s true, 250kg onions worth ?2500 have been stolen from Gujarat vegetable shop during the early hours of dawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Government in Jitters & Public in Tears </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a looming onion crisis has put the government in jitters as well as the general public in tears. Therein, huge strata focussing on several households, cafes, and restaurants have been affected adversely. In short, this food inflation has made the entire nation cry where people are left with no choice just to maintain a cost-cutting for onion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Indian Government must enlighten the issue and should immediately take the concern into consideration. This is because the continuous spike in the price is neither good for the country and nor for the Indian traders and farmers who are stagnantly witnessing a great fall in the onion demand.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onion, with which every food tastes tasteless, is now getting reduced from the daily menus, dishes, and salads. However, to avoid the further disruption of the onion trade in the country, the government has placed orders for 6,090 tonnes of onions from Egypt to prevent India from Onion’s Crisis. This initiative would somewhere support the daily income of Indian farmers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope so, fresh and quality harvest may sooner hit the Indian market vanishing food inflation at its best.</p>\r\n',	0,	0,	0,	2000,	2,	'2019-12-06 05:32:46',	'2019-12-10 10:15:27'),

Ranging from chain snatching to mobile, cash, electronic gadgets and a lot more gets robbed or snatched away by various unexpected and surprising threatening tricks in just a blink of an eye. Herein, the practice of hypnotism is also encouraging robbers to take away the people’s belongings by their own will and wish. </p>\r\n<strong>Cases over Case, Reports are noted but gets Unnoticed </strong>\r\n<p>Over the past few years, Indians are being in a tap of such crime that people are not safe in their own house ranging from dusk and dawn. This is so because; there is no fixed time of robbers to attack and to rob. Therein, many shocking cases are being increasingly growing majorly in India. Every year, there have been a dozen reports that get noted in the police station for investigation and verification but unfortunately, nothing gets into consideration. Owing to such unethical practices of both the police and robbers, robberies of varied different belongings have become a business amongst illiterate and uneducated youth. </p>\r\n<strong>Robbery begins from one\'s own self </strong>\r\n<p>Moreover, youngsters are heavy in number, majorly of the teenage and the people up to an age of 25 years old. It’s completely an obvious fact that such people are more prone to drug addiction, drinking, smoking, adultery etc. and once they get addicted or attracted towards it, their only source of buying their stuff becomes either robbery or stealing. The unacceptable but the real fact is that it begins from one\'s own house itself such as taking away money from parents wallet without even informing them. This stealing of smaller amount later leads to the major robberies outside from their home. </p>\r\n<p>Such unethical, as well as illegal practices, have now become unsafe for the people to normally walk on the streets and roads majorly in the context of females. On the isolated streets, bikers come in a pair with the very fast speed and snatch away the gold or other materialistic belongings, mobile phones, cash, wallets etc whilst showing a gun or knife. The worst part of their trick is that sometimes they show the artificial or toy gun which seems like an original sample just to threat the people hovering around. Additionally, such incidents sound to happen in the deserted streets but unfortunately, it happens in the crowded areas where just because of the threatening practices people become helpless to help each other and other records the videos of the incident.</p>\r\n<p>Several times, any such sudden and threatening incidents leave the victim in a brutal state of mind, scared and injured that draws the attention of the general public present at the incident’s spot wherein, any one of them who feels essential to inform police, inform them, rest other just remain same in their happening activities. </p>\r\n<p>Also, these robbers are so cunning and smart that while performing robbery or snatching something, they change their clothes that increase their chances of not being caught. Most often these robbers either carry a pair of extra jacket or shirt with them and always apply some lubricated substances on their body so that, if they get cached by someone they could easily slip and can run away. After acquiring the stolen goods, these robbers sell the desired products and earn their desirable profits.</p>\r\n<p>Their smooth escaping practice makes them difficult to trace whereas, surveillance of CCTV sometimes could help to an extent. Owing to this, police have now become familiar with their unethical practices but unfortunately, do nothing until and unless they seem their own profit in helping the victim by any means or by a bribe.</p>\r\n<strong>If such remains continue to happen then, where would our nation go? </strong>\r\n<p>Thus, people are requested especially the females to carry the essential precautionary measures with them such as a pepper spray, a pointed pen, knife or anything that could be beneficial in self-defense. </p>\r\n<strong>Eat, Repeat and Sleep – Robbery </strong>\r\n<p>Moreover, if an accused get caught and punished, their punishment gets restricted till imprisonment of some time. After getting released, they do the same practices again just to eat, repeat and sleep which happens in the jail as well. So, such people don’t get affected while getting caught. </p>\r\n<p>Thus, this won’t work in building a better as well as the developed nation instead; both the purpose and practice of crime highly need to be figured out. If this could be done, the prisoners must be rehabilitated prior to getting bailed or released. Also, they should be gone to some psychiatric therapy sessions so that no individual gets threatened again and feel unsafe on hovering on the isolated streets.<br/>\r\nHence, by identifying the root cause of the problem and solving it accordingly could work better with time, somehow and someday. </p>',	0,	0,	0,	5000,	2,	'2020-01-30 12:01:26',	'2020-02-10 12:38:24'),

Herein, the targeted employees are either the over-qualified people as per the company’s standards or the employees that are high salaried.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the organizations plan layoffs majorly for cost-cutting or due to the stagnant business strategies.

Also, in the era of technology as well as digitalization, Information Technology (IT) domain is phasing the rough period of streamlining cost majorly concentrating on the employees of mid to senior level.

The nation is in the hope that no rape case may take place and no girl crossing on the road becomes a victim.

This is actually so because the word epidemic itself comprises of a huge meaning in its existence. An epidemic could be anything which begins with a small symptom and later turns into a big disease and hence is termed as Epidemic.</p> <br />\r\n<p>These days, the same is happening in the case of Coronavirus. However, people are getting various information and facts regarding the virus and hence, is listed as the infodemic.<br/> <br />\r\nAs the Coronovirus is rapidly increasing in the major countries of the world wherein, China has been hugely tapped by it. The virus has been s threatening and has proven to be life taking amid the people that everyone fears with its name. The major issue is the recognition of the same i.e. how to analyse and diagnose that whether a person is suffering from some illness is either Coronavirus or something else. So, the symptoms and diagnosis of the virus are mentioned below: <br/><br />\r\n· Fever <br/><br />\r\n· Cough <br/><br />\r\n· Shortness of breath  <br/><br />\r\n· Runny Nose <br/><br />\r\n· Headache  <br/><br />\r\n· Sore Throat <br/><br />\r\nThough such symptoms are found to be very common and can be easily cured but in case of such virus, these symptoms should not be overlooked as it has caused a large number of deaths these days in just the couple of days. Thus, for confirmed, 2019-nCoV infections have reported a severe illness leading death. </p><br />\r\n<p>It is also believed that the symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear either in 2 days or as long as in 14 days. Also, it is entirely based on the incubation period of the MERS virus. Apart from such noticeable symptoms, it also includes some other symptoms as well such as 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. All such symptoms generally caused some upper-respiratory tract illnesses majorly in the context of common cold, pneumonia or bronchitis. However, such illness is basically found in the people suffering from cardiopulmonary disease and the people with the weaker immune system. </p><br />\r\n<p> In addition to this, one should also enlighten that the other two associated symptoms of Coronavirus i.e. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have also become frequently familiar with the people resulting in life-ending happenings. With the sufferings of such virus, approx. 3-4 people out of 10 have been sentenced to death on almost frequent hourly intervals. </p><br />\r\n<strong>What precautions one should take for avoidance and prevention of Coronavirus? </strong><br />\r\n•    Frequent hand washing with alcohol-based hand wash or liquid soap as it would help in killing the germs and virus. <br/><br />\r\n•    Maintain respiratory hygiene. This would be only performed while covering both face and mouth with tissue paper or handkerchief mainly while coughing and sneezing. Doing so would help in preventing the germs and virus and could contaminate the objects or people you come into contact with. <br/><br />\r\n•    Stop touching your mouth, face, nose and eyes because touching such surfaces could result in virus contamination. Touching such parts may result in virus transferring immensely and exceptionally. <br/><br />\r\n•    Avoid consuming animal’s products (all forms of non-veg) and stop being into contact with the animals like camel, rats, cats, rodents, birds, bats and dogs as well. <br/><br />\r\n<p>Therefore, the diagnosis of such symptoms has been essentially required to save people from the massively growing epidemic all around the clock. Your doctors and other health care providers should examine you by performing some of the laboratory tests on respiratory specimens all the major blood test (called serum) in order to detect the presence of Coronavirus if any. If you found the test with positive results, then, you must immediately contact your doctor informing him about your recent travelling, non-veg intake and animal’s contact. A large number of MERS-CoV infections has been detected from Arabian Peninsula’s country and so, it becomes highly essential to note and report about your travel diaries and history or animal’s contact. Herein, animal contact fundamentally means with contact with camel or camel diaries and products.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Thus, if you are suffering from fever, cough and cold then, you should immediately pay <br />\r\nattention to the same before it becomes serious or life-taking. </p><br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	10000,	2,	'2020-02-05 06:10:14',	'2020-02-10 13:05:34'),

You heard right.</strong><br />\r\n<p> Why a girl who got raped on December 16, 2012, is not getting justice since then which should be announced to her criminals instantly during the incident.<br />\r\nRape is not a mistake but is a crime. The raped girl named “Nirbhaya” died because of her brutal and severe injuries in a Singapore hospital but unfortunately, her culprits are still alive till date. Wherein, it was expected that her culprits were expected to be hanged on January 22, 2020, in Delhi’s Tihar Jail, it got postponed for February 1st in the early morning at 6 am and now is continuously getting delay and dates over dates.</p><br />\r\n<p>This unethical behavior of delaying justice is disturbing the nation and most specifically the accused mother. Nirbhaya’s mom is eagerly waiting for the culprit’s punishment. Every time she stands with a hope of some good news for the culprits to be hung but unfortunately and alas!!! Instead of getting punishment, the tenure of their life is getting extended while delaying justice.</p><br />\r\n<p>Nirbhaya means fearless. Jyoti Singh who was 23 years old physiotherapist was gang-raped in a running bus at Munirka in South Delhi. She was so brutally raped, assaulted and thrown out of the bus with her friend (Avanindra Pandey). Because of this incident, Jyoti is named as Nirbhaya. Her friend was also assaulted. Both of them were thrown out of the moving bus wherein, the girl was thrown nude. Her boyfriend tried his best to save her life but unfortunately because of the severe internal injuries she was half dead and declared died in Singapore hospital. Doctor’s strived and tried their best to save her but just because of the lust of the 6 culprits, the girl exists no more. </p><br />\r\n<p>Out of the 6 people, 4 were the culprits wherein, Ram Singh and a juvenile were named as accused. However, the trial of the 5 adult men initiated in the special fast-track court since March 2013 but as of now, nation can see that since the beginning till date nothing has been changed instead, the culprits need of eating, sleep and repeat is getting extended. </p><br />\r\n<p>Ram Singh was the primary accused who allegedly committed a suicidal attempt in Tihar Jail by hanging himself after the beginning f the trial by the special fast track court. On the other hand, as per the concerns of the juvenile, who was also said to be the most brutal amongst all of the people, was sent to the Juvenile for 3 years.<br />\r\nAgreed if that Juvenile was eligible to be sent to the Juvenile for 3 years that absolutely doesn’t mean that his punishment was sufficient enough. Since the date of the incident, it has been almost 7-8 years, the juvenile would not remain juvenile. Additionally, the accused mainly named Mukesh Sharma, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta have been also grown and definitely could not be of the same age that they were during committing a crime. </p><br />\r\n<p>So, with such delays definitely, the aggression would rise in the nation’s peeps and especially in all the near and dear ones, those who are associated with Jyoti Singh. The nation needs a proper justice and answer to this heinous crime. What went wrong at that time and what is going wrong at present?</p><br />\r\n<p>As per the sources and news, it has been stated that the Supreme Court of India will hear the case on Tuesday wherein, the government of both the Central as well as the State Delhi has requested for a separate hanging for the 4 convicts. Most interestingly, the government had also challenged the verdict of Delhi High Court dismissing its plea against the execution of 4 men stay. This is because, the government had wanted a proper notice to be sent to 4 convicts wherein, a judicial bench headed by Justice R Bhanumathi hadn’t heeded this request and said that, the matter would delay further.</p><br />\r\n<p>Owing to this, the patience of the nations is being tested. Additionally, Vinay Sharma did file a mercy petition in front of President Ram Nath Kovind wherein, his appeal had turned down to another convict Akshay Singh filing a mercy plea. Filing mercy petitions have shown that the convicts are trying their level best to be released without being punished and are making each possible effort and loopholes to delay the execution.</p><br />\r\n<p>With seeing all such potential efforts of convicts, the Delhi High Court has given them a week time to finish exploring the legal help and thereafter the trial court will again start the proceedings for the execution of the case to come to an end. </p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	8000,	2,	'2020-02-10 06:07:19',	'2020-02-10 12:35:57');
